# Using SageMaker Notebooks

AWS offers different types of Notebook instances: SageMaker Studio, SageMaker Notebook Instances, and SageMaker Studio Lab. SageMaker Notebook Instances offer the most flexibility in terms of installing local software via conda/mamba or launching from custom containers. [Amazon SageMaker Notebook Instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/nbi.html) allows for 'on the fly' machine resizing and notebook scheduling, as well as not worrying about resource availability, but they run in a managed environment and offer less flexibility for installing custom software. Most machine-learning related software are pre-installed, but these can be hard to use for a lot of bioinformatic tasks where you need to install CLI tools with conda.


If you have been instructed to load a particular container than you need [SageMaker Studio](#set-up-sagemaker-studio)

Otherwise, you can continue below using the Sagemaker Notebook Instance

### Set up a SageMaker Notebook Instance

1. In AWS console, type **Amazon SageMaker** in search bar and click it:

  ![selectsagemaker](/images/images_for_creating_AWS_notebooks/Screenshot1.png)

2. On the left side bar click **Notebooks**:

  ![Notebooks](/images/images_for_creating_AWS_notebooks/Screenshot2.png)

3. Click **Create notebook instance**:

  ![create_new_notebook](/images/images_for_creating_AWS_notebooks/Screenshot3.png)

4. Give a name to your notebook. Choose a notebook instance type based on needs, Amazon Linux 2 as platform identifier, volume. Optional, create idle-shut by selecting create new lifecycle configuration and copy and paste [idle-shutdown.sh](/idle-shutdown.sh) and create configuration. Then click Create notebook instance:

  ![environment](/images/images_for_creating_AWS_notebooks/Screenshot4.png)
   
5. It will take about 5 minutes, your notebook instance to get ready:

  ![pending](/images/images_for_creating_AWS_notebooks/Screenshot5.png)
   
   
6. **Open Jupyter Lab**:

  ![jupyterlab](/images/images_for_creating_AWS_notebooks/Screenshot6.png)

7. Clone an appropriate repository from GitHub.com:

  ![upload](/images/images_for_creating_AWS_notebooks/Screenshot7.png)

8. Select a notebook and then kernel:

  ![kernel](/images/images_for_creating_AWS_notebooks/Screenshot8.png)

9.  To clone in your git repositories you can either use the git UI built in or by using the terminal. Using the git UI select **Clone a Repository** then paste the repo url and click **Clone**. To clone via the terminal make sure that you are in the SageMaker directory then use the command git clone [repo url]. Once you have done this you should see the repo

  ![Clone_Terminal](/images/images_for_creating_AWS_notebooks/Clone_Terminal.png)

10. **IMPORTANT**: **Stop** the kernel at end of your work to avoid getting charged.

### Set up SageMaker Studio

1. In AWS console, type **Amazon SageMaker** in search bar and click it:

  ![selectsagemaker](/images/images_for_creating_AWS_notebooks/Screenshot1.png)

2. On the left side bar click **Domains**:

  ![Domains](/images/images_for_creating_AWS_notebooks/Screenshot10.png)

3. Click **Create domain**:

  ![Create_domain](/images/images_for_creating_AWS_notebooks/Screenshot11.png)

4. Select **Set up for single user (Quick setup)** and then click **Set up**:

  ![Domain Setup](/images/images_for_creating_AWS_notebooks/Screenshot12.png)
   
5. It will take a few minutes for the domain to setup:

  ![pending](/images/images_for_creating_AWS_notebooks/Screenshot13.png)
   
6. Once the SageMaker Domain is setup, click **Studio** on the left sidebar:

  ![Studio](/images/images_for_creating_AWS_notebooks/Screenshot14.png)

7. Make sure that **Select Domain** and **Select user profile** contain domain and user then click **Open Studio**:

  ![Launch Studio](/images/images_for_creating_AWS_notebooks/Screenshot15.png)

8. This should take you to SageMaker Studio home:

  ### Option 1 - JupyterLab 

1. Once in studio select **JupyterLab** on the top left under **Applications**:

  ![Launch JupyterLab](/images/images_for_creating_AWS_notebooks/Screenshot17.png)

2. Select **Create JupyterLab Space**:

  ![JupyterLab Space](/images/images_for_creating_AWS_notebooks/Screenshot18.png)

3. Assign a name to the space,choose either to share domain or create private space, then select **Create Space**:

  ![JupyterLab Space](/images/images_for_creating_AWS_notebooks/Screenshot19.png)

4. Choose **Instance** and **Storage(GB)** based upon expected usage then select **Run space**: 

  ![JupyterLab Space](/images/images_for_creating_AWS_notebooks/Screenshot20.png)

5. Wait for the space to start up and then select Open JupyterLab once ready:

### Managing Running Instances
 To check the active resources the Running Instances section was added. Below explains where it is and how to check what is actively running. 

 1. Go to **Running insances** within SageMaker Studio and make sure all instances being unused are stopped. If there are unused instances in the Running status select the associated stop action:

  ![JupyterLab Space](/images/images_for_creating_AWS_notebooks/Screenshot33.png)

2. Wait for the instances to stop:

### Deleting Instances
1. Go to the Domain you are seeking to delete a instance. :

  ![JupyterLab Space](/images/images_for_creating_AWS_notebooks/Screenshot35.png)

2. After go to **Running insances** within SageMaker Studio and make sure all instances being unused are stopped:
