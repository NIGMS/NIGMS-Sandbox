 # **National Institute of General Medical Sciences Cloud Learning Modules**


## Introduction

This repository aims to teach students, researchers, and clinicians, among others, how to utilize the power of cloud technology for the benefit of life sciences applications and research. Here we present 26 cloud learning modules that represent unique use cases or scientific workflows. Types of data used across the modules include, but are not limited to, genomics, methylomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and medical imaging data across formats such as FASTA/FASTQ, SAM, BAM, CSV, PNG, and DICOM. Learning modules cover areas from introductory material to single-omics approaches, multi-omics techniques, single-cell analysis, metagenomics, and AI/ML imaging applications. 

These modules run in Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Microsoft Azure (Azure). All modules will be available across the three cloud platforms in 2027, but you may notice that a given module is only available in one or two of these platforms at this time. You can run these modules in any cloud account, but we encourage users to request access to an [NIH Cloud Lab](https://cloud.nih.gov/resources/cloudlab/) account for an optimal experience. 

To get started with any of the cloud platforms, visit the NIH Cloud Lab Jumpstart Pages for [AWS](https://cloud.nih.gov/resources/cloudlab/aws-jumpstart/), [Azure](https://cloud.nih.gov/resources/cloudlab/azure-jumpstart/), or [Google Cloud](https://cloud.nih.gov/resources/cloudlab/google-cloud-jumpstart/), or visit the tutorial pages: [AWS](https://github.com/STRIDES/NIHCloudLabAWS), [Azure](https://github.com/STRIDES/NIHCloudLabAzure), [GCP](https://github.com/STRIDES/NIHCloudLabGCP). 

:exclamation: _If you require support at any time, please [open an issue on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue) for the module in question, or [send us an informative email](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask) at CloudLab@nih.gov._
